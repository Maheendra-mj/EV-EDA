# EV-EDA
In this the complete EDA was performed on the dataset having the Electric Vehicles in US States

# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on Electric Vehicles, conducted as part of an internship at Innomatics Research Labs. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in the electric vehicle industry, particularly in terms of vehicle range and adoption patterns, using univariate and bivariate analysis techniques.

# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze the dataset related to electric vehicles, uncovering key trends and insights that can inform industry decisions and innovations, particularly in terms of battery performance, vehicle range, and geographic adoption of electric vehicles.

# Key Tasks:
## Univariate Analysis:

### Focused on the distribution of electric vehicle ranges.
Identified common trends and outliers to understand variations in battery capacity and vehicle performance.
Bivariate Analysis:

### Explored the relationship between electric vehicle range and model year.
Highlighted the technological advancements of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) compared to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) over time.
Geographical Distribution:

Used Choropleth maps to visualize the distribution of electric vehicles across different regions.
Provided insights into regions leading in EV adoption and areas requiring further infrastructure development.
Vehicle Manufacturer Analysis:

Conducted a comparative analysis of top electric vehicle manufacturers using boxplots.
Visualized the evolution of the EV market with a Racing Bar Plot, highlighting the rise of key players over time.
Tools & Libraries Used
Python for data analysis and visualization
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib/Seaborn for static data visualization
Plotly Express for interactive geographic visualizations (Choropleth maps)
Racing Bar Plot for dynamic visualization of EV manufacturer growth
